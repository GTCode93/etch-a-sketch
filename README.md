# etch-a-sketch

05/22/2023 Create new repository!
This project from TOP is to create an in-browser Etch-A-Sketch where the user can decide the amount of pixels the width and height of a grid is. Whenever the user hover's their mouse over the grid, the grid's squares will turn black to simulate drawing!
Looking forward to mixing all three coding languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) I know into one project for the first time :D

05/24/2023 Finished project!
I finished the project. Yup lol. I had a lot of fun and this was the funnest project I've done so far :D Not many comments and things I learned that were crazy, but all the stuff I learned that's new is in the Notion!
